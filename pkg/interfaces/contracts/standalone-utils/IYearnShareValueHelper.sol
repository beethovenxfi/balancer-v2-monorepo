// The YearnShareValueHelper allows us to query a more precise rate than the pricePerShare (pps) provides.
// The pps on the YearnTokenVaul is returned in the precision of the underlying main token (ie: USDC = 6),
// but internally it stores more precision than what is represented in the returned value. So, with larger numbers,
// using the truncated pps can cause precision errors when converting between shares and underlying.
// The YearnShareValueHelper was implemented to overcome this limitation of the pps.
// Contract was written by wavey (yearn dev)
